# StandardML Worker Library
## Description

StandardML is a Python library designed to standardize the process of 
training and evaluating machine learning models. It provides a set
of utilities for preprocessing data, training models, and 
evaluating performance, while also promoting reproducibility and scalability.

The toolkit includes a set of prebuilt functions that can be easily 
customized to fit the needs of a specific project. The functions
cover common machine learning use cases, such as data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, 
and hyperparameter optimization.

StandardML is designed to be easy to use and flexible, and can be 
integrated into any machine learning project. It supports a wide 
range of machine learning frameworks and can be used with any dataset.

## Key Features

- Prebuilt functions for common machine learning use cases, such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
- Support for multiple machine learning frameworks, including scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
- Built-in hyperparameter optimization to maximize model performance.
- Support for custom data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines.
- Automatic logging of model performance metrics and training progress.
- Support for multiple evaluation metrics and reporting of evaluation results.
- Reproducible and scalable machine learning workflows.

## Target Audience

This project is intended for data scientists and machine learning engineers who want to standardize the process 
of training and evaluating machine learning models. By providing a set of prebuilt functions and promoting 
reproducibility and scalability, StandardML can save time and resources while also improving the quality of the models.
